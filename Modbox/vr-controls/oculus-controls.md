* When playing on SteamVR these are the Default Bindings, and can be changed in the Bindings UI SteamVR interface

* When using Stick/Teleport Locomotion the Left Joystick moves and the Right Joystick rotates (can switch which controller moves in VR Settings). Pushing in the movement Joystick can then be used for 'Jump'.

* Trigger can also be used to Grab ingame.

* If 'Drop Toy On Grab Release' is on (Defaults to On), Toys will drop from hand on letting go of Grip.

Modbox on PC can be started in either Desktop mode or VR mode, and can be switched at any time while playing in the main menu. Steam will automatically open in VR mode if already in VR.

Modbox starts in the Lobby - the default Home environment when no creation is set.

Once ingame you can switch between VR and Screen in the 'User Options' menu

Modbox supports up to 4 local user at once on the same screen, along with a VR user. Screen user can use Keyboard+Mouse or Gamepad

To join as a Local user connect a Gamepad and use the 'Join as New User' option in the main menu:

      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
The 'User' screen can be used to remove Local Users - and set some of their options (such as default avatar, name, different controls)

      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
By default VR users will not show on the screen after other local players join - use 'Always show VR on Screen' in the Settings to enable showing the VR user's view.
Local users can then join a online game and all play together online.

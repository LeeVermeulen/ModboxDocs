Default movement keys are WASD and Right Joystick on Gamepad, which can be changed in the Controls menu in Settings.
When Playing how the Player moves depends on the <<glossary:Player Avatar>> they are in - the default Player Avatar is a Humanoid with standard Walking / Jumping controls.

* When in play mode or editing (and not using the Desktop Edit mode) the controls are shown in the bottom left of the screen (which can be turned off in Settings).
* There is a 'Interact' option for both right and left hand. On using the Interact button a Radial Menu will appear with Interaction options for that hand. This could include toys to pick up, buttons to push in the world - or <<glossary:Tool>> options to switch to.

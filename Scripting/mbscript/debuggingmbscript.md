‘Debug Mode’ can be used to pause the game when a code line is hit, to allow for seeing values and stepping through code.

Here a ‘Breakpoint’ is added that once hit (on the On Collision’ method), play mode will pause and the scripting window will open to that place in the code.

The icons can be hovered over to see the current value.

"Pause\Breakpoint on Error" in Creation Settings can also be used to pause and highlight and MBScript errors (such as a variable or component not found)

* The World can be switched from Edit to Play mode. On switching to Play mode the world is saved - and all physics / component logic is enabled.
* The player can switch between playing and editing also. Players can use edit mode <<glossary:Tool>>s - or screen players can use [Desktop Editor](doc:desktop-editor).
* Entities are connected together when they are in Edit mode by touching if they have 'Autoconnect' on. When Connected they will be a single physics body in play mode.

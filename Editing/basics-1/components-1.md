* Components are on Entities and set their behavior and other properties such as physics / how they look. New components can be made in either MBScript or C# programming

* Entities always have a 'Main' component which sets properties like the Entity name / if it's disabled, and a 'Transform' component which sets where it is in the world and what it's connected to.

* Creations can be uploaded online to Steam Workshop or on ModboxGame.com When joining a server running a Creation from a online source, new players will download the creation (and any changes the server has made).
* Assets can also be uploaded online. When a Asset is uploaded (like a Prefab) all of the assets it uses will also be uploaded (that are in the creation and not from mods, like other Prefabs / MBScripts)

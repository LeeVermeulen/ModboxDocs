* All environment / physics / graphics options for a World are in World Settings.
* Can set the <<glossary:Environment>>, which might add more options to the World Settings. Sometimes the Environment will just set the default Sky / Ground Material and have a blank ground. Some Environments will have a Voxel Terrain ground. Environments can also be entire Unity scenes included in mods created with the <<glossary:ModboxSDK>> .
* Other World Settings include physics options such as Gravity and Time Scale

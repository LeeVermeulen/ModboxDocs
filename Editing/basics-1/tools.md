<<glossary:Tool>>s  in Modbox are on the players hand both for VR and Screen players. They can also be used while playing as a <<glossary:Player Avatar>>  if the <<glossary:Creation>>  allows for it.

Use the radial menu (with the Interact button on screen, or in VR with the trackpad/joystick) to select a tool. For some tools another window will open up to set controls / edit.

When using a Tool as a screen player - some tools will have another tool window which will open in the other hand. The other Interact button can then be used to switch to that window to set options.

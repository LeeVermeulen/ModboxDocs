* 'Managers' are scripts made in [MBScript](doc:mbscript) that are always added to the world.
* By default some creations come with a 'Player Manager', that controls spawning players into the world and setting their avatar's position. Creations can edit the script of this manager to control how players spawn (or if they can).

* Managers can be easily accessed by scripts, and they always exist as a single instance (like [Singletons ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) in other programming languages)

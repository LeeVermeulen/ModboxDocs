* Creations have a Environment set
* Sometimes the Environment will just set the default Sky / Ground Material and have a blank ground. Some Environments will have a Voxel ground. 
* Environments can also be entire Unity scenes included in mods created with the ModboxSDK. See [Unity Scenes to Environment Assets](doc:unity-scenes-to-environment-assets) for creating a Environment asset from a Unity scene.

* A 'Modbox Material' is applied to Primitive Entities - the player chooses the Modbox Material ingame when creating primitive entities. It sets how the primitive looks, and it's Physics Material

## Importing New Materials and Material Editor
* Textures can be imported ingame, and then used as Materials
* Open the 'Assets' screen in World Options to see materials included in mods, and to import new ones.
* Materials can have a 'Base Material' from a Mod, which can set the Shader settings. Any Shader properties are then displayed and can be edited.
* To add new Shaders - use the [ModboxSDK Guide](doc:modboxsdk-guide) to include new materials/shaders in mods.

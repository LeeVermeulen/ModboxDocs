* <<glossary:Humanoid Model>>s are used by the Humanoid component as a model
* They have a Human shape and IK systems designed for human interaction (2 hands / head / legs)
* 'Humanoid' component is on the default [Player Avatar](doc:player-avatar)'s for VR/Desktop

* Humanoid Models can also include new [Entity Components](doc:components-1) - like Lip Sync, Expressions, facial systems, etc - that can then be edited / scripted.
